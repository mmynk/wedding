# Reethika & Mohit's Wedding Website

This is the source code for the wedding website of Reethika and Mohit (that's me). The website is built using React + Vite and deployed via Cloudflare Workers & Pages.

P.S. This is also an attempt to not feel completely useless during the wedding planning process.

P.P.S. Feel free to use this code as a template for your own wedding website or whatever. Just make sure to replace the names and photos, otherwise it might get a little awkward.
