## Background

This started as a wedding website for Reethika and Mohit (that's me) - an attempt to not feel completely useless during the wedding planning process. It's since grown to include other special occasions.

Feel free to use this code as a template for your own event website. Just make sure to replace the names and photos, otherwise it might get a little awkward.
